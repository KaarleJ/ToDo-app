# ToDo-app
This app is a very simple Todo-app. The goal of this project is to get to learn Spring Boot a bit better and firstly create a simple CRUD api. I will also implement token based authroization and a postgres db in the backend. For the frontend I will be using Typescript, React and Tailwindcss.
